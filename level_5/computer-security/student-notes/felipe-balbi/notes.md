## Defining computer security

With the advent of the Internet, computer security became a very
important field of research.

Computer Security is the *protection of computer-related assets
against danger, loss or loss of control of something valuable*.

Security has three main goals:

-   **Prevention:** The safeguarding of assets from threats;
-   **Detection:** Systems that alert if malicious activity is, or is
    about to, take place;
-   **Reactiion:** Definition of procedures that enables us to deal
    with an attack.

Security can also be split into three main components:

-   **Policy:** deals with confidentiality, integrity and availability
    of data;
-   **Threat Model:** assumptions about those involved with malicious
    activity;
-   **Mechanism:** The SW/HW used to make sure the policies are
    enforced using the assumptions made during Threat Modelling.

There are five important terms that need to be defined:

-   **Attack:** activities harmful to computer systems, data, software,
    and hardware;
-   **Risk:** the possibility of damage or loss of digital assets in
    case of an attack;
-   **Zero-day (vulnerability):** a vulnerability used by an attacker
    before its discovery by the developer of the SW;
-   **Exploit:** SW used to take advantage of a bug or vulnerability;
-   **Hacker:** Subdivided into three groups
    -   **White Hats:** Find vulnerabilities with a goal of fixing them
        before its discovery by an attacker. They work under the
        permission of the owner of the computer system being attacked;
    -   **Black Hats:** Try to penetrate the system to gain unauthorized
        access. Often, their motivation is harm operations or steal
        sensitive operations;
    -   **Gray Hats:** They fall somewhere in-between White Hats and
        Black Hats and work with varying combinations of good and bad
        intentions.

## Types of malicious software 1

Malware is a piece of softwarte designed to disrupt, damange and
destroy an information system. There are many types of malwares,
some of which are discussed in the following subsections


<a id="orgc804fa4"></a>

### Viruses

They self-replicate by inserting themselves into other files,
programs, documents, etc. Can spread through emails, USB sticks
and downloads from unknown sources.

The *Creeper* is considered to be one of the first computer
viruses. Developed in 1971, it infected computers connected to the
ARPANET, the internet prototype.

Another early virus was the *Elk Cloner*. Written by a high-school
student to infect Apple II computers using floppy disks
in 1982. Every 50th time the computer booted, it would display a
poem written by the hacker.

Not all viruses are harmless. The *I Love You* virus in 2000 caused
around $10 billion worth of damages by affecting nearly 10% of all
computers around the globe.


<a id="org4d47dc4"></a>

### Worms

They can replicate without attaching themselves to existing
software. The *Stuxnet* is a well-known worm, considered to be one
of the most destructive worms ever created. It was designed to
attack [Programmable Logic Controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller) by Siemes.

PLC devices are used for the automation of processes in
machinery. In this case, it targetted centrifuges in Iranian
nuclear power plants and altered the speed of the machine, causing
it to tear itself apart.

It&rsquo;s estimated that *Stuxnet* destroyed 20% of Iranian&rsquo;s nuclear
power plant centrifuges.


<a id="org0acf3b1"></a>

### Adware

These display advertisements on your screen during browsing or
online shopping. Possibly the most visible form of malware one can
encounter. Its main purpose is to collect user data.


<a id="org7023cd9"></a>

### Trojans

Trojans are named after the famous ancient Greek tale of the
invasion of the city of Troy by the Greek during the Trojan War.

After trying and failing several times to get access to the city,
the Greeks came up witha plan where squatter soldiers would hide
in the joint wooden status of a horse presented as a gift.

During the night, after entiring the city within the horse, the
Greeks broke out of the horse to attack the city.

Trojans have a similar way of working: they hide themselves inside
an application or program data and spread based on specific user
action.


<a id="org5879e84"></a>

### Spyware

Designed to spy on the target machine or the user, it collects
information and sends it back to the hacker for further use or for
sale on the dark web.

The *Dark Hotel* spyware is one famous case which used Hotel Wi-Fi
to target the personal systems of government officials, business
tycoons and political leaders to extract sensitive information.


<a id="orga63f137"></a>

## Types of malicious software 2

We have a look at *Keyloggers*, *Ramsonware*, *Botnets*, and
*Rootkits*.

A *Keylogger* records every keystroke from the user. This may
include messages being typed, emails, confidential information such
banking credentials, users, passwords, etc.

*Olympic Vision* is a keylogger used for Business Email Compromise
(BEC) attacks. It also uses several other pieces of malicious
software to steal sensitive information and spy on business
transactions. Nowadays it&rsquo;s very easy to get a hold of a keylogger.

In a *Ramsonware* attack, the victim&rsquo;s data is encrypted, backup
files are deleted and the people responsible demand money in
exchange for decryption of this data. In other words, the victims
are held to *ramsom* for renewed access to their data. The
*WannaCry* attack is a recent example that took place in May 2017.

In a *Botnet* attack, computers connected to the internet are taken
over by an attacker which remotely controls the computers using a
Command And Control (CNC) server to carry out Distributed Denial Of
Service (DDOS) attacks. A DDOS attack is when a given server is
flooded with so much traffic at one moment, that it collapses.

*EchoBot* is a botnet used to exploit over 59 known vulnerabilities
and launch a number of attacks, such as DDOS attack, steal
sensitive information, conduct corporate espionage, and infects a
wide range of Internet Of Things connected devices. Furthermore, it
also scans for old vulnerabilities in legacy systems for future
exploitation.

Finally, we have *Rootkits*. These remain hidden in a target
computer and activate in secret. They can perform several
activities rangin from giving attackers remote access to a computer
all the way to stealing sensitive information such as a password or
credit card details. They can also use a compromised computer to
launch any of the other attacks described before.

# Week 2

Key Concepts

-   Explain the key differences between static and dynamic analysis.
-   Explain the usage of sandboxes in malware analysis.
-   Understand the need for a variety of methods of malware analysis.


<a id="org0e1ab34"></a>

## Malware analysis and techniques

Static Malware Analysis is one of the techniques used to analyze
and combat the types of malware discussed previously.

More generally, Malware Analysis is a set of processes and
techniques that help a Security Analyst understand the
functionality, origin, impact, and intent of malicious software.

The goal of this activity is find the *Indication Of Compromise*
(IOC) that depicts the behavior of malicious software. IOCs are
also used to develop signatures of malware. The two techniques used
for such analysis are Static Malware Analysis and Dynamic Malware
Analysis.

In Static Malware Analysis, the executable files are examined
without being executed. We can determine if a file is clean or
malicious and also discover information about its functionality.

With the information collected during Static Malware Analysis,
allows us to determine signatures, which are a collection of
distinguishing features that can be used to recognize malware.

Two essential techniques used in static analysis are antivirus
scanning and hashing. Antivirus scanning is the traditional method
of running a file through an antivirus scanner to try to detect
whether the file contains malware. Hashing is an algorithm that
produces a value referred to as a *Hash* which is a unique
fingerprint for a given file. Any modification to a file will
result in a different hash fingerprint, including infection by a
malware.

While static analysis methods are useful as a starting point for
some more basic types of attack, it can be powerless against more
recent and advanced types of malware. These have found ways to
circumvent the detection methods used during static analysis.

The solution to this is Dynamic Malware Analysis.


<a id="org334d63c"></a>

## Malware analysis 2

Dynamic Analysis or Behavioral Analysis is where we execute the
malware in a controlled environment known as a sandbox. This allows
a Security Professional to observe the behavior of malicious
software, help to understand its functionality and, hopefully, find
the Indicator Of Compromise.

This method overcomes some of the limitations of Static Analysis
with regards to catching the more advanced and adaptive forms of
malware.

Dynamic Analysis is an efficient method for analyzing malware
because it helps uncover the functionality of the malware, which is
not entirely possible with static analysis.

A Sandbox is a virtualized environment that contains a virtual
network, services, drives, etc, to ensure that the malware behaves
exactly as it would in a real environment.

There are two main types of sandboxes: Agent-based and
Agent-less. Agent-based sandboxes require software to be installed
on every computer that needs to be monitored. Well known examples
are cuckoo, threat expert, bit blase, and Comodo. Conversely, an
Agent-less sandbox monitors computers on the network from afar
without needing to be installed on every device. Popular examples
are VMRay, Analyzer, and SNDBOX.

Security Researchers use both types of sandboxes, but some research
suggests that agent-less sandboxes are more efficient.

Another common tool for dynamic analysis on Windows machines is
process monitor (Procmon). It&rsquo;s used to monitor the registry, file
system, network, running processes, etc.


<a id="org5ec9a4a"></a>

## Ethics

Ethics is really important in the field of Computer Security.

Because we frequently work with computers, we may be exposed to
security issues and vulnerabilities. When that occurs, we may be
able to fix the issue ourselves by setting a rules in our
*iptables* or blocking traffic from a certain port for instance.

There may be, however, wider ramifications to the problem we have
discovered. It could be something worth mentioning to the maker of
the faulty software.

That&rsquo;s where **Responsible Disclosure** comes into the picture. The
term itself is somewhat subjective, but there may be legal
ramifications related to the disclosure of a security issue.

In a situation where we find an issue in a popular software
package, e.g. a popular Operating System, it may be the case that
many other users are affected. This means that we have some
responsibility to the Company or Service Provider in terms of
disclosing the issue.

It is common practice to identify the bug to the provider and offer
them enough time to fix the issue before disclosing the problem
publicly. There are considerations about transparency.

Some companies may refuse to patch issues or even seek legal action
against those exploiting or even simply highlighting the issue.

We should also think about security in a distributed way. For
example, cloud computing services offer on-demand computing. These
services may not be hosted in the locality of the developer or the
client. As such, we must consider conforming to the law in **all** of
these locations.

As a final thought, actions have consequences. Identity theft and
distributed denial of service attacks have real world
consequences. People&rsquo;s lives can be destroyed if we do something
that can cause harm.

## Passwords

Designing truly secure systems is very hard, only made harder by
data leaks happening periodically as can be seen in the news. Data
is becoming more and more valuable and there are places in the
*Dark Web* where one can buy leaked data.

One of the most prolific leaks utilised a simple encryption method
where the same encryption key was utilized. This resulted in a
one-to-one mapping between plain-text and encrypted passwords. In
other words, there was a situation where different users with the
same password would end up with the same encrypted string stored in
the database.

What this means is that if one password is cracked, all other users
who happen to be using the same password were also compromised. To
make matters worse, some users used password hints, which were also
stored in the database.

Reusing passwords is also a common problem. If a user&rsquo;s password
for one service is leaked, there is a probability that the same
user employed the exact same password on multiple services which
renders all of such services compromised.

There are ways to design more secure systems, however that also has
implications. We could require longer passwords and encourage
two-factor authentication, but a user may loose their phone or
forget that longer, more complex password.

A good system design balances accessibility with security and
usability.


<a id="org7e12217"></a>

## Social Engineering

Insecure designs can have far reaching ramifications, however a
system is only as secure as its safest link.

Social Engineering is one of the most common attack vectors and it
does not rely on technical subtleties of attacks. These attacks
rely on the fact that not all staff are properly trained in
security and, as such, attackers may exploit gaps in their
knowledge.

A company may have a robust security policy in place to handle
access control, however **compliance** is a different
matter.

Phishing emails are a good example of Social Engineering
attacks. They try to trick you into thinking the email comes from a
reliable source and convince you to give them the information
they&rsquo;re after. Some of these emails may look fairly authentic and
we may have to look deeper to determine their authenticity.
